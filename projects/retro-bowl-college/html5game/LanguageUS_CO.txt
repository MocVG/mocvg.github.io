ui_RetroBowlRecord	GPA REQUIREMENTS
info_GPAExplanation	Players' academic performance is measured as GPA, where the lowest is 1.0 (or 0.0!) and the highest is 4.0 - although very few players will be able to reach a 4.0! Players' GPA drops during the season while they concentrate on Football training - but you can increase it by BENCHING a player, by using Coaching Credits in the MEETING area of the player profile, or through random events between games.##Different institutions require players to maintain different GPA levels to avoid suspensions. Every institution becomes more strict as players get closer to graduation - Juniors and Seniors will need to maintain a higher GPA than Sophomores or Freshmen.
